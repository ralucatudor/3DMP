## Course 3
#### Course #3.1 - Bodies vs Components

The difference between bodies and components: **components are free to move**, while bodies are static/ fixed in the environment (that's because **bodies are relative to the root component origin**, while **components have their own origin axis**)

Example - clock. How to make the clock work? Assembly - As-built Joint - select the components (the clock face and the hour hand) and then select the middle of the clock for the motion

#### Course #3.2 - Good practices when modeling in Fusion 360
- naming your components, sketches, versions, joints etc.! Name everything with suggestive names!
