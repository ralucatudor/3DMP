#### Lab #5.2 - How to use the loft command
Create a construction plane, which we'll use as a sketch plane \
-> create offset plane, then create sketch and select the offset plane just made

#### Lab #5.3 - How to use loft with rails

Rails mush touch every profile so...
1. Create a new sketch - choose the (in this case, vertical) plane - (create) project intersect - select the profiles & ok => the points of intersection of the profiles. Now that we have the intersection points, we can connect them. Create - fit point spline etc.
2. Same as 1., but for the other (vertical) plane.

Now we can add rails when using loft!
