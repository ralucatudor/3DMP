## Course 3
#### Course #3.1 - Bodies vs Components
The difference between bodies and components: **components are free to move**, while bodies are static/ fixed in the environment (that's because **bodies are relative to the root component origin**, while **components have their own origin axis**)

Example - clock. How to make the clock work? Assemble - As-built Joint - select the components (the clock face and the hour hand) and then select the middle of the clock for the motion

#### Course #3.2 - Good practices when modeling in Fusion 360
- Name your components, sketches, versions, joints etc. with suggestive names!
- Turn on **"capture design history"**!
- Learn more about Fusion: go to Data Panel - Basic Training
- Activate your component when you are working on it!

### Course #3.3 - Rapid Prototyping

#### Course #3.4 - Attach and calibrate canvas
Inserting multiple canvases to create a template for the shape of the 3D model.

#### Course #3.5 - 2D Sketch using canvas and dimensions
The key in 3D modeling is starting from simple 2D shapes and combining them in order to form complex 3D models.

#### Course #3.6 - Creating a 3D model from the 2D sketch
Extrude the correct sketches to obtain the 3D model.\
Having extruded the Parametric sketch, we can start the Direct Editing.

#### Course #3.7 - Importing references
Importing existing models and using them as references in sculpting our own 3D model.
grabcad.com - all the models are free (Note: if you are importing other models from other sites, do not forget to read the copyright)\
\- upload STP/ STEP files \

S - opens "Design Shortcuts", derive and then (in the next project) "break the link" from the previous

#### Course #3.8 - Place and align the imported references (Raspberry Pi)
Align tool\
Make rigid group

#### Course #3.9 - Place and align the imported references (Muscle sensor)

#### Course #3.10 - Place and align the imported references (Servomotor)
